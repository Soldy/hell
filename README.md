Hell is a simplified experimental UI/App tool for simple data flow and cache. 
Hell made the data check possible sometimes even when the backend goes offline because the indexeddb. 
Unlike most of the frontend tools, the Hell builds with one control JSON.
This JSON format is compatible with my Panthera layer. In short, that can build a complex database only with a couple hundred lines.  
This is just the first version. At the moment the code is extremely dense, and the docjs comments are missing.     
At the moment only one example project exists for this.
